This includes foreign corporations that are also tax residents of such countries, as well as government officials and other entities of a discriminatory foreign country.

Section 111102(a) modifies the definition of a low-income community, allowing for a lower percentage of poverty threshold (from 80% to 70%), which could make it easier for small businesses and rural communities to access opportunity zones.\n",

      "Furthermore, section 44301 expands and clarifies the exclusion for orphan drugs under the Drug Price Negotiation Program, which may help small businesses and rural communities by reducing the cost of certain medications.

While the text does not explicitly state which groups would be harmed most by the resulting Act, some potential groups that could be disproportionately affected include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Low-income individuals: The amendments to Section 1902 of the Social Security Act, particularly the new subsection (xx), may impact the community engagement requirements for certain individuals, potentially affecting low-income individuals who rely on Medicaid benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Undocumented immigrants and their families: The changes related to immigrant status, citizenship, and nationality might affect undocumented immigrants and their families, who could face challenges in accessing certain services or benefits due to their immigration status.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Rural communities: The amendment to Section 1400Z-1(Â¢)(1) may alter the definition of low-income communities, potentially impacting rural areas that rely on Medicaid funding for health services.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Small businesses and entrepreneurs: The introduction of qualified opportunity funds (QOFs) and qualified rural opportunity zone businesses might create new opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs, but they could also face challenges in meeting specific requirements or navigating complex regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Community-based organizations: The amendments to Section 1902 of the Social Security Act may require community-based organizations to demonstrate community engagement, potentially impacting their ability to provide services to low-income individuals or families.\n",

      "1. Oil and gas companies: The Act may impose new regulations or taxes on the industry, potentially reducing profits and competitiveness.\n",
      "2. Mining companies: Similar to oil and gas companies, mining operations might face increased regulatory burdens, taxes, or environmental restrictions, leading to financial losses.\n",

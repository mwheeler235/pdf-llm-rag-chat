This provision would impose an additional tax on distributions made to beneficiaries under the age of 30, which could disproportionately affect low-income individuals and families who may be relying on these accounts as a source of income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another area of concern is the proposed verification process for eligibility for health plans through exchanges (Section 112201). While this provision aims to prevent fraud and abuse in the exchange system, it could also lead to difficulties for low-income individuals and families who rely on government assistance programs to access healthcare. The increased paperwork and documentation requirements associated with the verification process may create barriers to enrollment and access to care for these vulnerable populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, some business entities, particularly those operating in qualified opportunity zones or rural areas, may be negatively impacted by certain provisions of the Act.
